# HabitiFit

A one-page Javascript and PHP powered application to update Habitica using FitBit data!  It's the perfect match!

##INFO
HabitiFit uses the PHP wrapper for Habitica's API V2 (https://github.com/Lamikins/Habitica_PHP) and uses OAuth's implicit grant mechanism.  Most data is also stored persistently using HTML5 local storage.

## NO LONGER MAINTAINED

Due to unforseen circumstances, I am no longer able to maintain HabitiFit.  Unfortunately this means I will be unable to update the application at this time.  Apologies.
